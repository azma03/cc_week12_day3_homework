Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz
------------------------------------------

Polymorphism
------------

1) What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
   Polymorphism mean Multiple forms or shapes.

2) What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
  In terms of subtyping polymorphism, we can use a reference of the parent class object
  to store an instance of the child class.

3) What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
   We can use method overloading, subtyping or parametric polymorphism.

4) How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
   An object can take multiple forms.

5) Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
  If we have to model a car which is made up of different components (e.g., Engine, wheels),
  we can create a parent class "component" which would be able to refer to all different kind of components.
  We could then create an Array list of type "component" holding Engine and Wheel objects.

Composition
-----------

6) What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
  It means passing the object of one class into another so that we can call the
  methods on the object being passed in.

7) When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
 If we have to implement a method to sell a car to a customer, we can pass a customer
 object to a method in the car. The car class would then be able to access public methods
 on that customer object e.g, updating customers wallet after the sale of the car.

8) What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
  It makes the code expandable and reusable.
